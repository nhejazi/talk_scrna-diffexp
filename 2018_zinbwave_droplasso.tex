\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep12pt
  \item Many experimental settings seek to isolate a subset of biomarkers from
    the full (larger) observed list observed in the experiments.
  \item Why ``differential''? Finding a subset of relevant biomarkers is done
    with respect to a particular condition of interest (e.g., disease).
  \item ...
